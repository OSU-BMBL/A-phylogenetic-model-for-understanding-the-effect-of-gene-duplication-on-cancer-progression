1. The source code is in the "src" folder.
2. The Mac binary is in the "mac" folder.
3. The windows executable is in the "windows" folder
4. The example control and data files are in the "data" folder

To compile the source code, open "makefile" and change "ARCHITECTURE ?= mac" to the platform (windows, mac, unix) of your computer. Then type make.

To run the program, type ./cancer control. It will generate an output file .out in which the loglikelihood and model parameter m are sampled from the MCMC algorithm. The posterior distribution of the phylogenetic tree is saved in the output file .tre.
