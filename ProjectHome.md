# **Cancer Evaluation: A-phylogenetic-model-for-understanding-the-effect-of-gene-duplication-on-cancer-progression** #

## Introduction ##
In the Bayesian phylogenetic model, the progressive stages of cancer are described as the tips of a phylogenetic tree. The duplication/deletion events may occur randomly along the branches of the tree. This model, together with duplication data, can estimate the duplication and deletion rates as cancer advances.
